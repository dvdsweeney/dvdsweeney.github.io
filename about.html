	<h1>What's all this?</h1>
  <p>I put together a basic site here on GitHub using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and following this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">tutorial</a>.</p>
  <p>Iâ€™m trying to keep this site very simple. Static pages that are hand coded in simple HTML and CSS. I write posts in plain text and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p> 
    <p>Complicated is easy. Simple is hard.</p>
