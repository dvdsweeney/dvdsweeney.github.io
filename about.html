	<h1>What's all this?</h1>
  <p>I put together a basic site here on GitHub using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and following this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">tutorial</a>.</p>
  <p>I’m trying to keep this site very simple. Static pages that are hand coded in simple HTML and CSS. I write posts in plain text and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p> 
  <p>Complicated is easy. Simple is hard.</p>
	<p>If the text on the site appears too small, try <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000779.htm">increasing the font size in your browser</a>.</p>
