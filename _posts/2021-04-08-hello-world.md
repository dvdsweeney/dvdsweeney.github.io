Put together a basic site on GitHub using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I followed this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

I'm trying to keep this site very simple. Static pages hosted here on GitHub. Posts are written in plain text and Markdown and I hand code everything. Complicated is easy. Simple is hard.
