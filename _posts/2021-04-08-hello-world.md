I put together a basic site here on GitHub using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and following this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

I'm trying to keep this site very simple. Static pages that are hand coded in simple HTML and CSS and hosted here on GitHub. I write posts in plain text and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Complicated is easy. Simple is hard.
